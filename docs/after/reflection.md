# Reflecting & Iterating

The end of the semester is a valuable opportunity to reflect on what worked, what didn't, and how to improve for next time.

!!! tip "Timing matters"
    Do your reflection while the semester is still fresh—ideally within a week or two of grades being submitted.

## Quick Reflection Framework

### What Worked Well? :material-check-circle:

Take note of:

- Activities that generated high engagement
- Assignments that produced quality student work
- Explanations or examples that really clicked
- Policies that reduced friction
- Tools that made your life easier

!!! quote "Keep what works"
    Don't overthink what's already working. Keep successful elements and iterate on the rest.

### What Was Challenging? :material-alert-circle:

Identify:

- Topics students consistently struggled with
- Assignments with unclear instructions or poor outcomes
- Points of confusion or frequent questions
- Time management issues (yours or students')
- Technology frustrations

### What Will You Change? :material-pencil:

Prioritize:

- High-impact changes that address real problems
- Small tweaks that are easy to implement
- Experiments you want to try
- Things to research or learn more about

## Structured Reflection Questions

### Learning & Assessment

- Did students achieve the learning objectives you set?
- Which assessments gave you useful information about student learning?
- Were there any assessments that weren't worth the time invested?
- Did the workload feel appropriate—for students and for you?

### Engagement & Classroom Climate

- How engaged were students during class sessions?
- Did students participate in discussions and activities?
- Did students seem to feel comfortable asking questions?
- Were there students who seemed disengaged? What might have helped?

### Logistics & Systems

- Did your grading approach feel sustainable?
- Were your communication patterns effective?
- Did technology help or hinder the course?
- Were your office hours well-utilized?

### Your Experience

- What energized you this semester?
- What drained you?
- What do you wish you had known at the start?
- What would make next semester more sustainable?

## Using Course Evaluations

Course evaluations become available after grades are submitted. Use them productively:

### Reading Evaluations

1. **Read once for patterns**, not individual comments
2. **Look for specific feedback**, not just ratings
3. **Note what students valued**, not just complaints
4. **Consider the context** (required vs. elective, class size, etc.)

### Responding to Feedback

- Identify 1-2 actionable changes based on feedback
- Don't try to fix everything at once
- Remember: you can't please everyone, and that's okay
- Consider sharing changes with future students ("Based on feedback, I've updated...")
