## "The best class sessions are the ones where I talk the least."

Dr. Sarah Chen used to lecture for the full 75 minutes of her Introduction to Economics course. Now, she rarely talks for more than 15 minutes at a stretch—and her students are learning more than ever.

### What prompted you to change your teaching approach?

> "I was teaching ECON 101 for the third time and noticing the same pattern: students seemed engaged during lecture, nodded along, took notes—and then bombed the first exam on the exact concepts I thought I'd explained clearly.
>
> I kept thinking I needed to explain *better*. But then I read *Make It Stick* by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel, and it clicked: the problem wasn't my explanations. The problem was that students weren't *doing* anything with the material. They were listening, but not actively processing."

---

### What does a typical class look like now?

> "I break the 75 minutes into chunks. It might look like:
>
> - **10 minutes:** Quick review quiz (ungraded, just to activate prior knowledge)
> - **15 minutes:** Mini-lecture introducing the new concept
> - **20 minutes:** Small group problem-solving on a realistic scenario
> - **10 minutes:** Groups share solutions; I highlight common approaches and errors
> - **15 minutes:** Individual practice with immediate feedback
> - **5 minutes:** Muddiest point exit ticket
>
> Not every class is exactly this formula, but the principle is the same: I talk less, they do more."

---

### How do students respond?

> "At first, some students didn't love it. They'd say things like 'Why aren't you teaching us?' I had to be explicit about *why* I was structuring class this way—I'd share the research on active learning and explain that the discomfort of struggling with problems is actually the feeling of learning happening.
>
> By midterm, most students had come around. And the evaluations at the end of the semester were the best I've ever had. One student wrote, 'I thought I hated econ, but I actually understand it now.'"

---

### What advice would you give to someone who wants to try this?

> "Start small. You don't have to transform your entire course overnight. Pick one class session and try adding a 10-minute active learning segment. See how it goes. Iterate.
>
> Also, prepare more than you think you need. When students are working in groups, sometimes they finish faster than expected. Have an extension activity ready.
>
> And embrace the messiness. Active learning is noisier and less predictable than lecturing. That's okay. That's actually the point."

### Quick Tips from Dr. Chen

!!! tip "On group work"
    "Groups of 3-4 work best. Any larger and someone always checks out. I also assign roles: one person writes, one person manages time, one person is ready to report out."

!!! tip "On getting started"
    "Steal shamelessly. There are so many resources out there. I adapted most of my activities from things I found online or borrowed from colleagues."

!!! tip "On difficult concepts"
    "The concepts students struggle with most are exactly the ones they need to *practice*, not just hear about. If I know something is hard, I build in extra practice time—even if it means covering less content."
