## Pro Tips from Faculty

!!! quote "On consistency"
    "I post every Sunday at 5 PM. Students have told me they actually look forward to it because they know exactly when to expect course information."
    
    *— Dr. Martinez, History Department*

!!! quote "On length"
    "My announcements used to be way too long. Now I write them, then cut them in half. If I need to explain something complex, I link to a separate page."
