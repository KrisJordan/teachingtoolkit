## Common Mid-Semester Challenges

??? question "Students aren't reading announcements"
    Try the **TL;DR approach**: Put the most critical information in a brief bullet list at the top. Save context and details for below the fold. See our [Announcements Checklist](announcements-checklist.md) for templates.

??? question "Attendance or engagement is dropping"
    Mid-semester slump is real. Consider a brief anonymous survey, a class discussion about what's working, or introducing a new activity type. Our [Midterm Check-In](midterm-checkin.md) guide can help.

??? question "I'm falling behind on grading"
    You're not alone. Consider whether you can provide meaningful feedback faster (rubrics, audio comments), or whether some assignments could be completion-graded. Talk to colleagues about sustainable practices.
