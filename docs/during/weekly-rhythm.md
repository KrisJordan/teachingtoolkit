Establishing sustainable weekly practices helps you stay organized, responsive, and energized throughout the semester.

## A Sample Weekly Rhythm

| Day | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| **Monday** | Review upcoming week, post weekly announcement |
| **Tuesday-Thursday** | Teaching days, office hours |
| **Friday** | Grading block, respond to accumulated emails |
| **Weekend** | Rest! (with perhaps some light prep for Monday) |

## Key Principles

1. **Batch similar tasks** — Answer emails at set times rather than constantly
2. **Protect prep time** — Block calendar time for class preparation
3. **Build in buffer** — Don't schedule every minute; unexpected needs will arise
4. **Set boundaries** — Define when you will and won't respond to students
