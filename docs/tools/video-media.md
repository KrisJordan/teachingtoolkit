## Quick Tips

1. **Keep videos short** — 6-10 minutes is ideal for engagement
2. **Break long content into segments** — Better for student focus and review
3. **Always caption** — Required for accessibility, helpful for all students
4. **Test audio first** — Poor audio is the #1 complaint about videos
