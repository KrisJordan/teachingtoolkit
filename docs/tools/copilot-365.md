* Optional file attachments
* Duration (free text customizable to 50 minutes)

The tool generates a structured document broken down into timed segments. You can edit the draft directly or enhance it with AI by changing _tone_, _length_, or providing custom instructions. You can go back to earlier drafts at any time.

When you are satisfied with a draft, in one click you an save it to your OneDrive as a Word document that is easily exported to PDF or further edited.

    Do you have a lecture you would like to add active learning to? Try uploading your current slide deck and a simple description prompt along the lines of, "I would like to iterate on my attached lecture to meet the same learning objectives but with additional moments of active learning exercises added in. Let's brainstorm."

### Rubric Creator

It is common for grading to be delayed by being stuck on the "rubric block" of crafting a fair rubric for an assignment. Copilot 365's Rubric Creator can help you brainstorm a starting point for a rubric. 

**Step 1. Information about the Assignment**

**Step 4. Edit and Export**

You can manually edit individual blocks, add and remove rows and columns, or further regenerate with AI. Once you are satisfied with the rubric, you can export it as a Word document to your UNC OneDrive for further editing or printing.
