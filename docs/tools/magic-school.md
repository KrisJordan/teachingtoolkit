## Limitations & Best Practices

### Limitations
*   **Knowledge Cutoffs:** Like all LLMs, it may not know about very recent events unless the specific tool utilizes web search.
*   **Accuracy:** It can "hallucinate" or provide incorrect facts. Math capabilities can be inconsistent.
*   **Generic Output:** Without specific inputs, the results can feel generic. The more detail you provide, the better the result.

### Best Practices
*   **The 80/20 Rule:** Let AI handle the heavy lifting (the first 80%), but always spend the last 20% editing, refining, and adding your personal voice.
*   **Human in the Loop:** Never copy-paste directly to students without review.
*   **Privacy First:** Even with privacy guarantees, avoid entering sensitive Personal Identifiable Information (PII) like student names or ID numbers into the forms.
