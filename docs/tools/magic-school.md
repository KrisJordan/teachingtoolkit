## Example Tools

MagicSchool has a wide variety of focused AI tools serving university instructors  through grade school. The tools below are those we beleve are relevant to Carolina faculty to help with brainstorming and drafting instructional ideas.

### Lecture Tools

#### [Lesson Planning](https://app.magicschool.ai/tools/lesson-plan-generator)

Generate a lesson plan based on a topic or learning objective and add additional criteria such as lesson length or information on pre-lecture assignments. The tool generates an editable lecture outline document with Learning Objective, Assessments (formative and summative), Key Points, and an outline of lesson structure. You are able to edit the document directly, edit your original prompt to regenerate all over again, or engage with a chat-like interface for refinements. Export to Word Document or Google Document is supported.

#### [Group Work Generator](https://app.magicschool.ai/tools/group-work)

Generate group work activity for students by describing the topic or objective, the duration of class time available, and selecting the group size. The tool will brainstorm roles and instructions for structured group work activities.

!!! success "60-second Idea: Add Roles to Classroom Group Work"

    Assigning roles to students in group work activities in class is [known to improve student learning experiences](https://cfe.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/326/2014/08/FYC23.pdf). Has coming up with roles and their instructions prevented you from trying role-based group work in the past?

    Try out the Group Work tool with one of your unstructured discussion activities in class! It can help you brainstorm roles along with draft instructions for how to structure an activity.

### Assignment Tools

#### [Rubric Generator](https://app.magicschool.ai/tools/rubric-generator)

Generate a custom grid-based rubric for any assignment. Specify your point scale, learning objective, assignment description (file upload, OneDrive upload, or copy/paste from Canvas are all supported), and additional customization. You can update these fields to regenerate with more specificity. For a visual demo, see the video linked above.

#### [Multiple Choice Quiz / Assessment](https://app.magicschool.ai/tools/mc-assessment)

Generate a multiple choice assessment, quiz, or test based on any topic or criteria. You provide the number of questions and description of assessment scope or upload a file, such as a PDF or word document. With a 75,000 word limit on input text, you can upload assigned academic papers or assigned readings for draft Guided Reading Questions. Answer keys are generated.

#### [Worksheet Generator](https://app.magicschool.ai/tools/worksheet)

Similar to the multiple choice tool, this tool generates a worksheet with fill-in-the-blank questions, multiple choice questions, and open-ended questions that can be used to brainstorm assignments. The worksheet can be edited directly as a document or you can give feedback or requested edits via a chat interface, for example "draft a few more challenging open ended questions that engage with the ethical concerns of this topic." Worksheets can be exported to Word or Google Docs.

## Cost

MagicSchool is a commercial tool that UNC does not have a site license to. However, it is free for general usage with reasonable limits on the number of generations used per day. For unlimited generations per day, the cost is $12.99 per month or $100 per year.
