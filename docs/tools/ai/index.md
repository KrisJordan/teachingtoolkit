## Principles for AI in Teaching

### 1. AI as Assistant, Not Replacement

AI works best as a tool that **augments** your expertise, not replaces your judgment. Use it for:

- Drafting content you'll review and refine
- Generating options and variations
- Handling time-consuming but routine tasks
- Brainstorming and overcoming blocks

### 2. Review Everything

AI output requires human review. Always:

- Check factual accuracy
- Ensure alignment with your course goals
- Verify appropriate difficulty level
- Adapt language and examples for your students

### 3. Be Transparent

Consider being open with students about how you use AI:

- Modeling appropriate use
- Discussing ethical considerations
- Setting clear expectations for their use of AI

### 4. Protect Privacy

When using AI tools:

- Don't upload student work or data without consent
- Use anonymized or hypothetical examples
- Review tool privacy policies
- Consider data storage and retention
