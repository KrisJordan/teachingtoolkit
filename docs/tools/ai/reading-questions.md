# Generating Reading Questions with AI

**Time savings: ~30-60 minutes per reading**

Transform lengthy readings into engaging discussion questions in minutes using AI tools. This guide walks you through a repeatable process for generating high-quality reading questions.

## Overview

Generating reading questions manually is time-consuming but essential for promoting engaged reading and meaningful discussion. AI can dramatically speed up this process while still allowing you to curate and refine the final questions.

### What You'll Need

- Access to an AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.)
- A PDF or text version of the reading
- 10-15 minutes per reading

### Learning Objectives This Supports

- Helping students identify key arguments and themes
- Preparing students for class discussion
- Encouraging deeper engagement with texts
- Building critical thinking skills

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Prepare the Reading

!!! tip "Keep it focused"
    For best results, work with one article or chapter at a time rather than multiple readings.

**Options for getting text into AI:**

=== "Copy/Paste Text"
    
    1. Copy the relevant text from your PDF or source
    2. Paste directly into the AI tool
    3. Works well for shorter readings (under 5,000 words)

=== "Summarize First"
    
    1. If the reading is too long, ask AI to summarize it first
    2. Then generate questions from the summary
    3. Review to ensure key concepts aren't missed

=== "Use PDF Upload (if available)"
    
    1. Some AI tools allow PDF upload directly
    2. Upload the document
    3. Reference it in your prompt

---

### Step 2: Write Your Prompt

The quality of questions depends heavily on your prompt. Here's a template:

```markdown
I'm teaching a [level] course on [subject]. Students will read the 
attached article/chapter before our class discussion.

Please generate [number] discussion questions based on this reading that:
- Move beyond simple recall to analysis and application
- Connect to [specific themes or concepts you're covering]
- Are appropriate for [undergraduate/graduate] students
- Include a mix of:
  - Questions about the author's main argument
  - Questions that ask students to evaluate evidence
  - Questions that connect to [broader course themes or current events]
  - One question that challenges students to disagree with or complicate the author's position

Format each question with a brief note about what aspect of the reading it addresses.

[Paste reading or reference uploaded document]
```

### Example Filled-In Prompt

```markdown
I'm teaching an undergraduate course on Environmental Policy. Students 
will read the attached chapter on carbon pricing before our seminar.

Please generate 6 discussion questions based on this reading that:
- Move beyond simple recall to analysis and application  
- Connect to our unit on market-based environmental solutions
- Are appropriate for upper-level undergraduate students
- Include a mix of:
  - Questions about the author's main argument
  - Questions that ask students to evaluate evidence
  - Questions that connect to current climate policy debates
  - One question that challenges students to disagree with or complicate the author's position

Format each question with a brief note about what aspect of the reading it addresses.
```

### Step 3: Review and Refine

AI-generated questions are a **starting point**, not a finished product. Review for:

| Check | Questions to Ask |
|-------|------------------|
| **Relevance** | Does this question connect to my learning objectives? |
| **Level** | Is this appropriate for my students' background? |
| **Clarity** | Will students understand what's being asked? |
| **Depth** | Does this go beyond what students could answer without reading? |
| **Balance** | Do I have a mix of question types? |

### Common Refinements

- Simplify overly complex questions
- Add context or scaffolding for challenging questions
- Remove questions that miss the point
- Adjust vocabulary for your student population
- Add your own questions for key points AI missed

---

### Step 4: Format for Your Use

**For Canvas Discussion Board:**

```markdown
After completing this week's reading on [topic], respond to ONE of the 
following questions in 200-300 words:

1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]
3. [Question 3]

Then, reply to at least one classmate's post with a substantive response.
```

**For In-Class Discussion:**

- Choose 3-4 questions maximum
- Order from more accessible to more challenging
- Prepare follow-up probes for each question
- Consider small group work before full-class discussion

**For Reading Quiz:**

- Adapt open-ended questions into multiple choice or short answer
- Focus on questions that verify engagement with the reading
- Combine with recall questions about key facts/arguments

---

## Sample Output

Here's an example of AI-generated questions with instructor refinement:

!!! example "AI-Generated Question (Original)"
    "How does the author's theoretical framework for understanding carbon pricing mechanisms intersect with neoliberal economic paradigms, and what are the implications for environmental justice?"

!!! success "Refined Question (After Review)"
    "The author argues that carbon pricing can be both economically efficient and equitable. What evidence does the author provide for this claim? Do you find it convincing? Why or why not?"

---

## Pro Tips

!!! quote "From Dr. James Park, Political Science"
    "I regenerate questions multiple times and combine the best from each batch. It takes an extra few minutes but gives me much better options to choose from."

!!! quote "From Prof. Lisa Torres, English"
    "I always add one question of my own that connects to something specific we discussed in the previous class. It helps students see the through-line of the course."

---

## Variations to Try

### For Different Question Types

**Bloom's Taxonomy Framing:**
```
Generate 2 questions at each level: remembering, understanding, 
applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating.
```

**Debate Preparation:**
```
Generate questions that could help students prepare to argue 
either for or against the author's main thesis.
```

**Connection Questions:**
```
Generate questions that help students connect this reading to 
[previous reading/concept/real-world example].
```

## Troubleshooting

??? question "Questions are too basic/surface-level"
    Revise your prompt to explicitly request higher-order thinking. Add phrases like "analysis and evaluation" and "require evidence from the text."

??? question "Questions don't match my course"
    Add more context about your course, students, and specific learning objectives. The more specific your prompt, the better the output.

??? question "AI didn't capture the key argument"
    Try explicitly summarizing what you see as the key argument and asking for questions about that specific point.
