## Quick Principles

1. **Start with the end in mind** — What should students be able to do by the end of the course?
2. **Align everything** — Ensure activities and assessments directly support your learning objectives
3. **Build in feedback loops** — Give students opportunities to practice and receive feedback before high-stakes assessments
4. **Consider cognitive load** — Break complex skills into manageable steps
5. **Plan for engagement** — Include varied activities that actively involve students
