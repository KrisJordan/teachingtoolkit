## Communication & Announcements

!!! quote "TL;DR Format"
    "I started every announcement with a bold TL;DR line summarizing the key action item. Student engagement with announcements increased noticeably—they actually started reading them."
    
    *— Professor, School of Journalism*

!!! quote "Consistent Timing"
    "I send my weekly announcement every Sunday at 5 PM. Students have told me they appreciate knowing exactly when to expect course information."
    
    *— Dr. Martinez, History Department*

!!! quote "Subject Line Strategy"
    "My announcement subject lines always start with the week number and a verb: 'Week 5: Submit your draft by Friday.' It makes scanning the announcement list much easier for students."
    
    *— Instructor, Writing Program*

## Office Hours

!!! quote "Coffee Shop Office Hours"
    "I moved my office hours to a campus coffee shop once a week. More students show up in that one hour than in all my regular office hours combined."
    
    *— Assistant Professor, History*

!!! quote "Walk-In vs. Appointment"
    "I split my office hours: two hours of drop-in time and one hour of appointments. Students who are anxious about office hours feel more comfortable booking an appointment, while those who just have quick questions appreciate the flexibility."
    
    *— Associate Professor, Psychology*

!!! quote "The First Visit"
    "I require all students to come to office hours once in the first three weeks—even just to say hi. After that initial visit, they come back much more readily when they actually need help."
    
    *— Senior Lecturer, Mathematics*

## Engagement & Participation

!!! quote "Muddiest Point"
    "I end every class by asking students to write down their 'muddiest point'—the thing they're most confused about. It takes 2 minutes and tells me exactly what to address next time."
    
    *— Associate Professor, Biology*

!!! quote "Think-Pair-Share Timing"
    "For think-pair-share, I'm very explicit with timing: 'You have 2 minutes to think on your own, then 3 minutes with a partner, then we'll share.' The structure helps students actually engage instead of immediately turning to their neighbor."
    
    *— Instructor, Philosophy*

!!! quote "Name Cards"
    "I have students make name cards for their desks for the first few weeks. It helps me learn names faster AND it means I can call on specific students, which increases participation dramatically."
    
    *— Lecturer, Political Science*

## Grading & Feedback

!!! quote "Audio Comments"
    "I started recording audio feedback instead of typing comments. It's faster for me, students find it more personal, and they actually listen to it. I use a simple voice memo and upload to Canvas."
    
    *— Assistant Professor, English*

!!! quote "Comment Bank"
    "I built a bank of common feedback comments in a Google Doc. When grading, I copy-paste and customize. It cut my grading time by 30% and made feedback more consistent."
    
    *— Graduate Teaching Assistant, Sociology*

!!! quote "Rubric Transparency"
    "I share my rubric before the assignment, then require students to self-assess using the rubric before submitting. The quality of submissions improved dramatically."
    
    *— Associate Teaching Professor, Computer Science*

## Time Management

!!! quote "Batching Email"
    "I only answer student emails twice a day—late morning and late afternoon. I put this in my syllabus and students actually seem to appreciate the predictability. And I'm much less distracted."
    
    *— Professor, Economics*

!!! quote "15-Minute Buffer"
    "I schedule a 15-minute buffer after every class in my calendar. That's when I jot notes about what worked, what didn't, and what questions came up. It saves so much time when I teach the course again."
    
    *— Clinical Professor, Nursing*

## Technology

!!! quote "Canvas Home Page"
    "I made my Canvas home page a simple 'what to do this week' checklist with links. Students stopped asking 'where do I find...' questions."
    
    *— Instructor, Communications*

!!! quote "QR Code Handouts"
    "I include QR codes on my slides that link to relevant resources. Students can scan with their phones and have the resource saved before they leave class."
    
    *— Assistant Professor, Information Science*
