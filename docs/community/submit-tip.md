# Share Your Teaching Tips

Have a teaching tip, technique, or tool that's made a difference in your courses? We'd love to hear about it—and share it with colleagues across campus.

---

## What We're Looking For

The best tips are:

- **Specific** — Tell us exactly what you do, not just general principles
- **Actionable** — Others should be able to try it themselves
- **Tested** — You've used it and seen results
- **Honest** — Including limitations or situations where it might not work

## Types of Contributions

### Quick Tips

Short, actionable ideas that can be described in a few sentences.

*Example: "I start every class with a one-question quiz on the previous session's material. It only takes 3 minutes, but it dramatically improved retention and attendance."*

### Detailed Practices

Longer descriptions of teaching approaches with context and examples.

*Example: A full description of how you structure group work, including how you form groups, what roles you assign, and how you debrief.*

### Tool Recommendations

Technology or resources that have helped your teaching.

*Example: "I use [tool] for [purpose]. Here's why it works for me and tips for getting started."*

### Faculty Spotlight Interview
