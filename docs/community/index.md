## Why Contribute?

The best teaching tips often come from the trenches—from instructors who've tried something, iterated on it, and discovered what actually works. Your contribution could help a colleague across campus save time, connect with students, or try something new.

**We're especially interested in:**

- :material-clock-fast: Time-saving techniques
- :material-lightbulb: Creative solutions to common problems
- :material-tools: Tool recommendations and workflows
- :material-account-group: Strategies for engagement
- :material-heart: What makes teaching sustainable and joyful
